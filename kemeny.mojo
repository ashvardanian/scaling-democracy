"""
Exact Kemeny-Young consensus ranking over a pairwise preference matrix.

Schulze answers who wins; Kemeny-Young answers what the whole ordering should be, choosing the
ranking that disagrees with the fewest ballot pairs. That optimum is NP-hard to reach by search,
so this is the Held-Karp subset dynamic program instead: `O(n * 2^n)` time against `O(2^n)`
memory, exact rather than approximate, and practical to roughly two dozen candidates.
